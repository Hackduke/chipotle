Chipotle is a rapidly growing gourmet food franchise and a staple in the diet of college students around the country, if not the world. However, in the midst of this culinary revolution, many students feel overwhelmed by the by the sheer number of franchises springing up left, right and center.

Our team has one mission: to make sure you never miss an opportunity to enjoy the food you love most.

We use a combination of Android, geofencing and Foursquare to let people know when they are within a pre-determined proximity of nominated venues*. We then use Google Maps to show the user precisely where it is and how to get as fast as humanly possible.

*In theory our application supports you querying venues other than Chipotle, but we don't recommend it.
